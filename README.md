## üß† Abstract
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they make mistakes in their reasoning paths.  However, our study reveals that when the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes difficult for the model to recover.  We refer to this phenomenon as the *"Prefix Dominance Trap"*.  Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this phenomenon.  Specifically, every T tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism, enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference.  However, we observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and reflection instructions effectively.  To address this, we fine-tune them into our **LeaP-T** model series.  Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025, and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements.  For instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks with an average gain of 3.3 points.  Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024.  In-depth analysis reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty.  LeaP marks a milestone by enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning.  Our code, datasets, and models are available at [https://learning-from-peers.github.io/](https://learning-from-peers.github.io/).
